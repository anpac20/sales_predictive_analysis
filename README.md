# Retail Sales Forecasting
This project simulates a real-world retail forecasting challenge using transactional data from Favorita stores in Ecuador. It includes:

Predictive modeling of daily sales per store and product family

Feature engineering with calendar data, promotion status, oil prices, and store metadata

Training and evaluation of a Random Forest model with and without lag variables

Visual validation using smoothed plots for stakeholder interpretation

The model was built using Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, and is intended for educational purposes and as part of my portfolio.
